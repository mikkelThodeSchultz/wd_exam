# wd_exam

Having problems with the pythonanywhere webhook.
Fix: Open bash in python anywhere and go to the wd_exam folder
type git status and see if there are uncomitted changes
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
git pull origin main

THEN Create the production.py file in python anywhere
Then changes the os.getenv() in x.py to strings
